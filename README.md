# Flatstat

A new website to browse Flathub statistics with ease. 

Features:

- Visualize downloads and uploads data 
- Get a download counter badge for your app (custom badges coming soon!) PS: open PR if you have design ideas
- Discover the most downloaded apps of this month and of all time on Flathub
- Search any app available on Flathub with the searchbar.

## Data source

All the data comes from Flathub's [official server](https://flathub.org/stats): an automatic script downloads the data daily, splits it into chunks and re-upload the files on my hosting provider.
